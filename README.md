# Challenge-1
Improving the accessibility of a website as our first week challenge.

I was tasked with solving problems on a website to be inclusive of people with disabilities
From this I have learned how certain attributes added in HTML make a site widely accessible, and how that presents when visiting the site: alt, title, head icon.
This project doesn't particularly stand out as it was a learning task on my coding journey.
Improvements should be made as I tried changing certain css attributes which resulted in the 'hero' image disappearing and the header de-centering.

EDIT: 
- Improvements were made and added to a new branch, "improvements". This was accessed from a pulled version of earlier commit in the repository.
- HTML/CSS code clean up.
